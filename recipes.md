My wife has requested that I record some of my recipes
<h3>Eggplant Parmasean</h3> 
Ingredients
- Eggplant, cut into thin slices
- Olive oil
- Dried Oregano
- Shaved Parmasean cheese
- Marinara Sauce
- Italian Bread Crumbs
- Fresh Italian Basil
- Salt

Notes: 
1. Preheat oven to 400F / 204C
2. Brush thinly-sliced eggplant with olive oil, both sides.
3. Season eggplant with salt and oregano and place in the oven for 15 min. If they were cut thin enough, they'll look almost like chips after 15 min.
4. Add the eggplant to a baking dish, whatever sized dish that the eggplant will cover the bottom in a single layer.
5. Layer marinara sauce, cheese, marinara sauce, cheese, marinara sauce, basil, bread crumbs, marinara sauce.
6. Place back in oven for 20-30 mins.
 
 The bread crumbs did not really hydrate that well so I had to mix them in later. I think I'll try a new approach next time. 

 This turned out really well so my wife reminded me to write it down.
