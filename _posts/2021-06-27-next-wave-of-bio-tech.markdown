We're watching a lot of new frontiers in technology emerge right now. This is my list of things that seem to be emerging that anyone interested in new tech should be paying close attention to. This article is a love note to myself to not miss the waves that I see coming, have my surfboard ready, but just miss the timing. 

## Proteomics
Next-generation sequencing has dominated the omics space for the past decade. While genomics will always have its relevance, [Proteomics](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmcbride1/2021/06/23/proteomics-the-next-truly-massive-investing-opportunity/) has made a lot of progress and I'm really excited to see how it evolves. Jonathan Rothberg, who could arguably be an Elon Musk-like figure for Biotech, is working on [Quantum-Si](https://www.quantum-si.com/), which will most likely emerge as the dominant Protein Sequencing technology over the next 5-10 years. [Rothberg](https://twitter.com/JMRothberg) is one of my heroes and I'd really love to interview (podcast?!) or even read his autobiography. 

## Web 3.0

The next [version of the internet](https://web3.foundation/) will most likely be decentralized and rely heavily on the Blockchain. Check out [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) and take a quick course on the [Blockchain in Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-blockchain). Also, watch the Youtube playlist (starting with Video 1 below) from Web3. Another layer to this is Cryptocurrency, which dominates the Blockchain discussion right now. That will change.

## AR/VR

I still feel that Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality is going to take over the world at some point. Ready Player One is probably one of my favorite fiction books of recent history (I'm still waiting on the Oasis btw). In Bo Burnham's Inside, Bo (satirically) compares the real-world as one engages with a coal mine: suit up, gather what is needed, and return to the much more safer, more relevant digital space. 
For AR, think DBZ-style scouters that are somehow socially acceptable. Pop-ups over people that display (when allowed) social media profiles, moods, etc.,. 
For Virtual Reality, imagine [training](https://www.wlwt.com/article/cincinnati-childrens-using-virtual-reality-to-transition-thousands-of-front-line-workers-to-new-building/36845435) to be whatever you want to be from your home. 


## Closing

The future is coming fast and it's really exciting. One thing that we'll have to reconcile at the same time: Environmental Tech is going to need to catch up and keep pace with everything else. Covering technology that solves environmental problems, particularly climate change, will be for a later date.

Peace.
