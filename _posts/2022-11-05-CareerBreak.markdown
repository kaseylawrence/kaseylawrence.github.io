Amidst the dumpster fire going on over the past few days at Twitter, I wanted to share some thoughts and advice for those that are freshly out of a job. Layoffs have been increasing lately in tech circles. Currently, I am on leave because my daughter decided to make a super early appearance. She is currently in the NICU, and my time off work does feel like I'm unemployed day-to-day. Thankfully I'm still getting paid. A few years ago, I spent about six weeks between jobs, and it. was. difficult. I learned some lessons then and am learning some more now.

1. Embrace the break and create
Not everyone gets a true chance to take a career break. Reframe being laid off/fired as a true opportunity to slow down, focus, and work on your dreams. Time may dilate during this time and looking back, your time off will feel like a blur. Focusing during this time will be your superpower.
2. Find a routine, including sleep.
I highly debated putting rest at number one. Give yourself the permission to sleep and you will likely not realize how much rest your body needed. Then, find a routine. Plan your days and your weeks. Leave time for deep work/learning and for play. 
3. Eat well and exercise
The urge to snack all day will be strong. Make sure you're eating well and exercise at least 2-3 times during the week. Exercise will help your mental clarity and for me, helps me not feel like garbage.
