## [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
As a code editor, I personall don't think there's a better option than Visual Studio Code. VSCode has so many extensions and options, it's an iceburg of possiblity.

## [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io)
Gitpod is so useful for merging github and VSCode in one experience. Since I'm hosting this blog with jekyll and github pages, I use github to create new posts and commit my changes. Gitpod makes that easy, from my browser or from VSCode.


## [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
I work with APIs a lot now. Almost two years ago I was still trying to learn what APIs were. Postman is the gateway drug to...nevermind. There was one tutorial that really stood out for me when trying to learn APIs, and Postman in particular. That video is below:

## [Linode](https://linode.com)
For a cloud computing platform alternative to the big players, I'm all in with Linode. I really like their platform and ease of use. I'd ask you to use my referral link to sign up and you'll get a credit, but I don't have a link yet...since I signed up with a credit and have to spend $25 to get my link. So just find someone promoting Linode on Youtube and use theirs. Deal?

So yeah, some of my favorite tools right now. Do you have a favorite? Send me a twitter message.
