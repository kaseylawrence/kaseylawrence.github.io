<!---Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. --->

{% highlight python %}
print("Hello World!")
#ugh I hate Hello World tutorials.
{% endhighlight %}
It's been a while since I've posted. In fact, I was originally hosting my site with surge.sh (static) and it wasn't for me. So now I'm trying Jekyll (yes, it's still static, I know) and github pages with this domain. Wish me luck.

Side note: I'm now a Field Apps Scientist at a company that I've been a customer of for ten years now. It's been pretty nuts to watch the Genomics space explode over the last few years. I'm really looking forward to growing more with coding, using APIs, and Bioinformatics.

Some lessons that I learned from my last job (it wouldn't take much digging to figure out where):
  - I was incredbily miserable for two years. 
  - It's ok to walk away from something that you've built from scratch.
  - Some people won't understand your decisions and that's also ok.
  - I had a rash on my forehead and some other physical symptoms that magically vanished with my role.
  - No one on YouTube wants to talk about the hard parts about leadership and "hussle culture" is incredibly toxic.


I'm excited for what the future holds and I can't wait to travel more and to actually enjoy my life. Who knew?! I'm surrounded by some incredibly smart people and definitely feel like a fish out of water - my roles over the past few years have pulled me away from coding and informatics and I'm rusty again.
