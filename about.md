I'm Kasey. I'm currently a Field Applications Scientist for Enterprise Software in the genomics space. Previously I was a Molecular Lab Technical Director for Oncology and after a long struggle, embarked on a different route that is more involved with bioinformatics, coding, and customer-facing. Here I post about random things and use this domain as a bit of a code sandbox. Right now I'm using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [namecheap](namecheap.com).
